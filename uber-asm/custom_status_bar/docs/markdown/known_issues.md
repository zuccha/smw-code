# Known Issues

This UberASM has a few known issues that I plan on fixing:

1. If `!status_bar_visibility = 1` in settings, when it is turned off on a
   single level, the status bar will still be visible for an instant before
   disappearing.
2. If `!status_bar_visibility = 1` in settings, when it is turned off on a
   single level, the status bar will reappear after display a message on screen
   (e.g., message box).
3. If `!status_bar_visibility = 0` in settings, when it is turned on on a single
   level, the status bar sometimes uses the wrong color palette.
